Great work there. Ok background: I spend all day with you in Claude Code, tens of millions of tokens over the past few months. I know that you can be jawdroppinly good. We have refactored 50,000 line codebases, rebuilt from scratch, created new opensource libraries, mods, stuff I would never have expected possible even 6 months ago. As I result shit like that is all I talk about, especially with ym fiance. She knows LLMs are goign to be huge but never had a wow moment. This an opprtuntiy to show her that wow moment.

In your latest research you have provided great information. We need to comgine that with the high level iteinerary i provided in my message and arrive at the perfect four day rome tour guide. I dont what is possible with claude desktop. How advanced can artifacts get? Private web pages? Interactivtiy? Lets discuss

Hopefully this explains where I want to end up. A detailed iteinerary with all the detail you provide, different options, ticket prices, ticket links ALL OF IT IS GOLD. This is the opportunity to show my fiance why I spen 15 hours a day talking with you. Lets dicuss.
